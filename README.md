# Rusty Spoon

Rusty spoon is a file-based decentralized issue tracking, inspired by Ditz.

Issues are stored in a human-rw format, so technically you could use rusty
spoon without having rusty spoon installed.

The tool provides a convenient way to create, edit and read issues, while
keeping them in files so they can be versionned with the code.

## Basic usage

ToDo

## Build

    rustpkg build spoon
